This repository houses a graphical comparison and analysis of cancer treatments.

The drug under investigation is Capomulin, and we would like to see its relative market and overall performance.

A few of the graphical representations that can be viewed in the output_graphs folder are:

Metastatic Spread During Treatment
Survival During Treatment
Tumor Change Over Treatment
Tumor Response
Key observations are located within the Observations.txt file.

Here's why Capomulin is important:
* Reducing cases of Cancer
* Saving lives
* Living life to its fullest
* Reducing cost of Cancer treatments and strain on medical institutes
